                    <p class="largeParagraph">
                        My job in the United States Air Force is as a Respiratory Therapist and a Cardiac 
                        Cath Lab Technician. What this includes is invasive cardiology procedures such as 
                        left and right heart catheterization, pacemaker and defibrillator implants, 
                        electrophysiology studies and ablations, and much more. My specific role in these
                        procedures is to assist the physician by running specialized equipment, retrieving 
                        supplies for the procedure, documenting the procedures, and pre/post patient care. 
                        While my focus for the future is on becoming a software engineer, the medical field 
                        is still interesting to me as it has been my line of work for the past three years.

                    <p class="largeParagraph">
                        Basketball is another interest that I have always had. I enjoy both playing and
                        watching NBA basketball games. My favorite NBA team is the Miami Heat. I am also a fan of 
                        Lebron James so I have also taken a liking to the Lakers due to his recent move to LA. I look
                        forward to seeing the California rivalry that will come during the playoffs if the Warriors and
                        Lakers play each other.
