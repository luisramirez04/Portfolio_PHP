                        Trump Hole is an iOS game that was released into the Apple App Store in 2016. The basis of 
                        the game is that Donald Trump is trying to not get eaten by Hillary Clinton. The player
                        controlled Donald Trump by jumping left and right to fall through walls that are dragging
                        him to Hillary's mouth. Every wall that Mr. Trump got past is 1 point. Get eaten and
                        start again from 0 points. This was my first game that I ever developed. This was very
                        challenging because I have never worked with vectors, acceleration or a game engine in 
                        the past.

                        Sold is an application that was released into the Apple App Store in 2016. It allowed people
                        that sold items on Facebook to be able to search for comments to thier ads and see who 
                        wrote the comment, what time, and on what item. This was commonly used for people to search 
                        for who the first person to respond with "sold" to one of their ads". This project was very challenging
                        due to it being the first time I was working with external APIs in Swift. I also integrated a
                        animation framework to add some styling to the login screen.
